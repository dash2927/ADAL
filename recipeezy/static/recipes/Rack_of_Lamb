NAME:
Classic Rack of Lamb
CUISINE:
Holiday
DESCRIPTION:
I live for lamb chops. Juicy, tender, rare (please please give me rare), deep reddish pink, browned, crusty, herbed, fatty goodness.

So, when my father sent me on a mission to make rack of lamb (what? Eight lamb chops in a row?) I was all over it.

My version uses a simple rub with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, fresh chopped rosemary and thyme.

The trick is to not go overboard with the herbs. The lamb tastes so good on its own. The seasoning should complement the lamb, not dominate it.
